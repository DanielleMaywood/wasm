# Hello World in WASI Preview 2

## Requirements

- `wasm-tools`
- `wasmtime`

## Running

```bash
make run
```

## How it works?

First I want to preface this by saying: I have absolutely no idea how you're
expected to handle dependencies with the `wasm-tools` set of tools. I've
instead opted to hand craft all the dependencies myself.

TODO: Fill this out
